OSS currently spawns processes until hitting a nanosecond limit. It logs directly to standard output.
I was able to create the shared memory for the clock, for the process contro table and blocks.
I was able to create the message queue and pass messages back and forth between the children.
The children simply read their process control block and terminate currently.
The shared memory is terminated at the end of parent execution.
I was not able to implement the round robin queue or multifeedback queue, and therefore did not complete any sophisticated logging or statistics.
